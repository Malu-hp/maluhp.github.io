# About Me ........
Well dont want be a narcissit but here it goes
#### Software engineer by day, hacker by night
* Im a software engineer primarily focussing on Backend and Site Reliabilty , I also build dashboards in React.js with minimum stack powered through node.
```
//Languages known 
Python , Java , C++ , React , Golang [ basic] , Linux Kernel / Bash scripting and Javascript[ Node] 
```
* I love building apps and contributing to the open source and creating an impact. As cliche as that sounds I try to give back as much to the community by improving and removing a lot dead code that is redundant.

* I have build a lot of automation tools focussing on site reliability to ensure microservices / applications are up and running.
